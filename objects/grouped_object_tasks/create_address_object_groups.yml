- name: Add some address objects to the firewall
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local

## Ensure the Palo Alto Ansible Role (Collection) has been installed. There are some requirements as well for the
## role. Often you will get prompted if you need a specific module such as for example paramiko.
## Review documentation here - https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-ansible

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos

## This is the vars file which is used to create the service objects. Add the objects into here that you
## would like to deploy.
  vars_files:
    - ./address_objects.yml
    - ./address_object_groups.yml

## This variable is referenced with the commit action at the end of the play.

  vars:
    - panos_provider: 
        ip_address: '{{ fw_ip_address }}'
        username: '{{ fw_username }}'
        password: '{{ fw_password }}'
        api_key: '{{ api_key }}'
    - address_objects: ./address_objects.yml
    - address_object_groups: ./address_object_groups.yml

## This admin list is used by the commit action at the end to commit any changes by specific users,
## with this playbook, it will be leveraging fvwadmin1 user only, adjust accordingly.
## Any other commits currently sitting in the Palo's will not be committed if they are under another user.

    - admins:
       - fwadmin1

  tasks:
  - name: Grab the credentials from ansible-vault
    include_vars: 'vaultfile1.yml'
    no_log: 'yes'

## This is the beginning of the changes

  - name: Create address objects from vars file - address_objects.yml
    panos_address_object:
      provider: '{{ panos_provider }}'
      name: '{{ item.value.address_name }}'
      value: '{{ item.value.address_ip }}'
      description: '{{ item.value.address_description }}'
      state: 'present'
## In order for this to work you need to have an existing an existing tag, so ensure this tag exists
      #tag: ['AnsibleTest']
      commit: no
    with_dict: "{{ address_objects }}"

  - name: Create address object groups from vars file - address_groups.yml
    panos_address_group:
      provider: '{{ panos_provider }}'
      name: '{{ item.value.address_group_name }}'
      static_value: '{{ item.value.address_objects }}'
      commit: no
      #tag: ['Prod']
    with_dict: "{{ address_object_groups }}"

## This will commit these changes, remove this command (or comment out) if you do not wish for it to
## automatically commit and would like to review the pending changes in PanOS GUI.

## Ensure the Palo Alto Ansible Role (Collection) has been installed. There are some requirements as well for the
## role. Often you will get prompted if you need a specific module such as for example paramiko.
## Review documentation here - https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-ansible

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos

## This is the vars file which is used to create the service objects. Add the objects into here that you
## would like to deploy.
  vars_files:
    - vars/address_objects.yml
    - vars/address_object_groups.yml
    - ./tag_objects.yml

## This variable is referenced with the commit action at the end of the play.

  vars:
    - panos_provider: 
        ip_address: '{{ fw_ip_address }}'
        username: '{{ fw_username }}'
        password: '{{ fw_password }}'
        api_key: '{{ api_key }}'
    - address_objects: ./address_objects.yml
    - address_object_groups: ./address_object_groups.yml
    - tag_objects: ./tag_objects.yml

## This admin list is used by the commit action at the end to commit any changes by specific users,
## with this playbook, it will be leveraging fvwadmin1 user only, adjust accordingly.
## Any other commits currently sitting in the Palo's will not be committed if they are under another user.

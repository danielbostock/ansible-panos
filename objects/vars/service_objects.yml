## Service Objects Vars File used with create_service_objects.yml

## This vars file is a dictionary var file. 

## Dict File Items
## InsertService#Name:
## Change the <InsertService#Name> to whatever you want for reference, it is not used by the play, it 
## used for structural organisation. The name of the object created is the service_name key pair.
## 
## Keys Pairs
## service_name: = This is the name of the service you want to create
## service_port: = Port number
## service_description: = Description
## service_protocol: = UDP or TCP
## service_group_name: Exact name match of the service group name existing or desired

## Things to note
## All pair values are mandatory.
## If service name already exists, it will not be overwritten, the names have to be unique so if the port
## is different to the name, you will need to modify.
## If service_group_name is not exact, a new one is created - be sure the spelling is correct.
